AL	Alabama contracts with private probation companies to collect traffic citations and other fines and fees. Harriet Cleveland, who filed a lawsuit challenging the process, was ordered to serve a month in jail for her inability to pay traffic tickets. Alabama has also closed many of its driver's license offices. 28 counties now lack a DMV location, including every county where African Americans make up more than 75% of the population. These closures have made it harder to get a photo ID's in order to vote, and to deal with a license suspension.
AR	Arkansas enacted a new law, Act 1139, that allows a driver to get their license reinstated for $100 if it was only suspended for failure to pay. The first person to take advantage of the new law had previously been incarcerated for four months because of her inability to pay.
AZ	In Arizona you can be charged with up to six months in jail, a $2,500 fine for driving with a suspended license. Authorities can also impound your car. 
CA	In California there are four million people who currently have their license suspended for failure to pay a fine or appear in court, 17 percent of the adult population. Reports show that poor and minority communities are impacted disproportionately, the rate of suspension for failure to pay is five times higher in black and Latino communities than the state average. Black drivers are more likely to get arrested for these offenses compared to white drivers, and minorities are more likely to receive traffic citations. California uses collection agencies, and authorities can impound drivers' cars.

LA	Louisiana's Office of Motor Vehicles sent out 1.2 million letters to drivers with lapsed insurance, in an attempt to collect over $444 million in unpaid debt. Louisiana recently allowed the OMV to refer unpaid fines to the  state-run collection agency.
MA	Massachusetts passed a law in 2016 that repealed a law requiring license suspensions for non-driving related drug crimes. In 2014 Massachusetts issued 5,431 suspensions for drug crimes.

MD	Maryland lawmakers recently agreed to an expensive criminal justice reform bill, which eliminates the possibility of going to jail just for driving with a suspended license. 
ME	Maine issues warrants for failure to pay fines, and court-ordered fees.

MN	On town in Minnesota allowing residents to pay parking tickets by donating canned goods to a local food pantry.
MO	In Missouri failure to appear in municipal court for a moving violation results in a license suspension. In Ferguson you can only get your license reinstated if you pay your fines and fees owed in full. In St. Louis County there used to be five reasons you could get your license suspended, now there are 26. While you technically cannot be jailed for failure to pay, a warrant can be issued if you don't show in court to say that you can't pay. 
MS	In Mississippi some are saying that certain town and counties have resurrected the debtor's prison, jailing people for inability to pay fines and fees. Debtor's prison was abolished in the U.S. almost 200 years ago, and in 1983 the U.S. Supreme Court found that incarcerating people for an inability to pay fines and fees was a violation of the 14th amendment. Despite this, many municipalities are raising fines and fees to try to generate revenue, and jailing people when they don't pay.

NC	In North Carolina an analysis by The New York Times found wide racial differences when it came to police conduct and enforcement. The analysis found that the majority of black drivers in Greensboro, NC who were pulled over were stopped for regulatory or equipment violations, violations for which police officers have the discretion to ignore. 
ND	
NE	In February 2016 police in on Nebraska town decided to crack down on unlicensed drivers, issuing 17 citations for driving with a suspended license in a 24-hour period.

NH	
NJ	In February 2015 a lawsuit was filed challenging New Jersey's policy of automatically suspending a driver's license for failure to pay child support.

From 2010 to 2014 New Jersey issued approximately 20,000 license suspensions per year for failure to pay child support. 
NM	
NV	
NY	In New York a suspension can be issued for insurance lapses. A local news anchor was arrested in February 2016 for driving with a suspended license. Her spokesperson said that her license had been suspended for a previous insurance lapse, even though her insurance was currently valid. According to a database of all IDs issued in New York, the suspension rate is approximately xx.
OH	Ohio is considering changes to its license suspension laws. The state senate passed a bill in April 2016 that would allow, rather than require, judges to suspend driver's licenses for conviction of a drug crime.
OK	Oklahoma's legislature recently unanimously passed a reform bill that would make it easier for formerly incarcerated people to get their driver's licenses back. 
OR	
PA	Pennsylvania passed a law requiring valid photo ID in order for vote, and advocates are concerned that people with suspended licenses might think they cannot vote.

WA	In Washington 380,000 drivers have their license suspended, and there is a new law being proposed that would help suspended drivers get their licenses back. In the state 33 percent of misdemeanor criminal cases are related to driving with a suspended or revoked license, licenses which are often suspended for failure to pay. 
WI	In 2012 as Wisconsin was passing the voter ID law which was implemented for the first time in the 2016 presidential primary, experts testified that between 200 and 350 thousand voters in Wisconsin did not have valid voter ID. In 2014 Wisconsin issued 200,000 failure to pay suspensions. Only 65 percent of Milwaukee County residents have a valid driver's license, compared to the average rate of 83 percent in the rest of the state. Suspensions for failure to pay make up more than half of all suspensions, and the two-year suspension issued for failure to pay is more than the length of suspension for a first OWI offense.
WV	In West Virginia in March 2016 police reported that more people are driving with suspended licenses. In West Virginia the first offense for driving with a suspended license is just a fine, but the cost can go up for later offenses and can lead to jail time.
