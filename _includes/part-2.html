                    <h2>Impacts of License Suspension</h2>

                    <p>Having a suspended license suspended can disrupt a person’s daily routine, <a data-toggle="tooltip" class="tweet" title="<img src='http://harrietrowan.github.io/driving-poverty/img/tweet_92.png' />" >cause them to lose their job</a> or <a data-toggle="tooltip" class="tweet" title="<img src='http://harrietrowan.github.io/driving-poverty/img/tweet_103.png' />" >prevent them from getting a new job</a>. It can hamper their ability to care for family members, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" class="tweet" title="<img src='http://harrietrowan.github.io/driving-poverty/img/tweet_122.png' />" >disrupt their social life</a>. It can even land them in jail. These negative consequences are compounded in rural areas and other places that lack good public or alternative transportation.</p>
 
                    <p>Lacking a valid driver’s license often results in difficulty finding employment. Some employers ask for proof of a valid driver’s license even when driving is not required on the job. Many industries, like construction work and home health care, rely on workers with valid driver’s licenses, and they have difficulty finding employees due to the high rate of suspensions.</p>
 
                    <p>An analysis conducted in New Jersey in 2006 showed just how devastating a suspension can be for job prospects. That study showed that 42 percent of people who got their license suspended subsequently lost their jobs. Only 45 percent of those who lost their jobs were able to find new employment, and 88 percent of those who were able to find new employment took a pay cut.</p>
 
                    <img class="sidebar-left" src="http://harrietrowan.github.io/driving-poverty/img/NY_counties_placeholder.png" /><p>Beyond the burden license suspension puts on an individual, it is a heavy responsibility for the systems that issue, administer, and enforce those suspensions. Dealing with license suspensions is an expensive and time-consuming task for police departments, courts systems, and department of motor vehicle (DMV) locations.</p>

                    <p>The AAMVA report estimated that “law enforcement agencies spend millions of dollars and lose thousands of personnel hours each year in the administration of social non-conformance related suspensions.”<sup>1</sup></p>

                    <p>It found that arresting and processing someone for driving with a suspended license takes about nine hours of personnel time. The state of Washington alone likely spends 80,000 personnel hours per year, the equivalent of 40 full-time employees, just to deal with suspensions for non-highway safety reasons.</p>

                    <p>License suspension also causes problems in proving identity, age, or residence if the license is actually physically confiscated, as it sometimes is when a suspension is issued, or when someone is pulled over for driving on a suspended license. In some states you are supposed to <a data-toggle="tooltip" class="tweet" title="<img src='http://harrietrowan.github.io/driving-poverty/img/tweet_15.png' />" >surrender your physical license</a> when it is suspended. Unless the person has a passport or has arranged for alternative government-issued identification, <a data-toggle="tooltip" class="tweet" title="<img src='http://harrietrowan.github.io/driving-poverty/img/tweet_14.png' />" >they could have difficulty flying</a>, buying alcohol, or otherwise proving their identity.</p>
 
                    <p>Even the process of getting a new ID could be a challenge for someone with a suspended license. To get a new ID a person must find a ride to a DMV or <a data-toggle="tooltip" class="tweet" title="<img src='http://harrietrowan.github.io/driving-poverty/img/tweet_145.png' />" >choose to drive without a license</a>. In addition there is usually a fee for getting an identification card.</p>
 
                    <p>Lack of identification could also <a data-toggle="tooltip" class="tweet" title="<img src='http://harrietrowan.github.io/driving-poverty/img/tweet_133.png' />" >prevent a person from votin</a>. The report on license suspensions in New Jersey found that almost half of people whose licenses were suspended lacked identification after the suspension.</p>
 
                    <img class="sidebar-right" src="http://harrietrowan.github.io/driving-poverty/img/tweet_141.png" /><p>The full effects of license suspension in states where photo ID is required to vote is unclear. But not having identification could discourage people from going to the polls if they know they need to provide a valid ID. Advocacy groups have pointed out that low-income communities and communities of color are less likely to have IDs in places like Wisconsin and Alabama where laws requiring valid government-issued photo ID are being implemented.</p>
                    
                    <p>Because police officers are allowed to use their discretion when it comes to pulling people over and issuing minor traffic violations, traffic violation interactions are particularly vulnerable to implicit bias and racism.</p>
 
                    <p>A report released in April in California paints a stark picture of the racial disparity in license suspension and how arrests for driving with a suspended license disproportionately affect communities of color. The report showed that black and Latino residents are more likely to get their license suspended for failure to pay, and are more likely to get arrested for driving with a suspended license than white residents. The report showed that the rate of suspension for failure to pay or appear in black and Latino communities was five times higher than the state average. These racial disparities extend to the national level.</p>
 
                    <p>In some states drivers are required to pay for certain courses in order to clear a suspension on their record, which can cost hundreds of dollars. Suspensions can also raise insurance premiums, or result in a <a data-toggle="tooltip" class="tweet" title="<img src='http://harrietrowan.github.io/driving-poverty/img/tweet_106.png' />" >refusal of coverage</a>.</p>
 
                    <p>Depending on the state, unpaid fines and fees can be passed along to a collection agency, which further increases the fine and can ruin a person’s credit score, making other things in life, like getting loans or lines of credit, more expensive and less accessible.</p>
 
                    <p>Some jurisdictions impound the car of a driver with a suspended license. A report from Menlo Park, California found that the most common crime in the city was driving with a suspended license, which often led to impounding the car in question. More than half of those whose cars were impounded never get them back. The cost of retrieving an impounded car can sometimes rise to more than the car is worth.</p>
                    
                    <p>For someone who is just getting by, a license suspension can easily be the catalyst that pushes them over the edge, causing them to lose their job or end up in jail.</p>
                    
                    <p>Suspensions create a vicious cycle of deepening poverty. To get a license reinstated a person has to pay the original fine, any administrative fees, applicable late fees, and an additional reinstatement fee.</p>
